        "The **Diamond Problem** occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor, causing ambiguity in method resolution. For example, if class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, and `B` and `C` inherit from a common superclass `A`, Python needs to determine which version of a method from `A` should be called. Python resolves this issue using the **C3 Linearization** algorithm, which determines a consistent **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to avoid ambiguity. The MRO is computed by considering the inheritance hierarchy and ensuring each class is searched only once in a depth-first order. This ensures that the most specific class is checked first. You can view the MRO of any class using `Class.mro()`. The key points are:\n",
        "1. Python avoids ambiguity by calculating a consistent MRO.\n",
        "2. The method resolution follows a depth-first search with specific rules to ensure no class is visited more than once.\n",
        "3. The C3 algorithm guarantees predictable behavior even in complex multiple inheritance scenarios."
